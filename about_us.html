				The management is made up of people who have had long years of experience in HR and industry in Indian and abroad. The idea to start this project stems from the fact that there is less emphasize on individuals and more on turnover which tends to spill over into too much wastage of openings  and services in the HR sector. Individuals and organizations come out with their view on how it can be managed which results in the mushrooming of consultants and placement agencies on a daily basis confirming to the old phrase 'dime a dozen'. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We at Building bridges believe that no matter what you do, how much you educate yourself, or how high you rise in personal settings, the personal touch must never be forsaken. We base our working on this human touch. We empathize with the candidates and work with industry to place the right people for the desired openings. Our team is skilled enough to separate the wheat from the chaff not only on the basis of resumes but also on the basis of knowing the candidate. This entails a lot of investment by way of time, but the end result is robust and strong, we identify persons according to their character and substance which in turn is matched with the culture of the organization where they are to be placed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Our learning and development team</i> ensures that life's experiences are blended into the craft of training and content development which in turn produces a sweet mixture of modern day learning without eroding the base. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our services on <i>payroll management and event management</i> are so designed to afford maxim maneuverability to the industry leaders without having to bother with the everyday grind. We believe reliving the leaders of their daily bother so that they can concentrate on moving their business forward.
			</p>
			<p>
				For <i>startups we have the expertise to advice on the right HR composition to start with and plan the functions accordingly</i>. Alternatively they can entrust us with their activities which we will help start off so that the people on the desk are trained adequately in the process and systems that need to be followed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Organizations that are already having a HR department and doing reasonably well but where productivity and bottom line figures are not thrilling and deviate from expectations, we offer consultancy services on filling the gaps in the system. We study the entire process and prevalent systems to come out with a clear cut guideline which will offer a steep rise in output with a corresponding northward shift in bottom lines.

			<p>
				In a nutshell we allow you to breathe easy while we do the leg work and the pushups to make your organization fit and healthy.
